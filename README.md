# FOOD_BOX_HERO

Here at FoodBox Hero we aim to end the global epidimic of food waste while simultaneously helping those in need.

With 1.3 billion tons of food wasted each year it only makes sense to put some of that in the hands of the less fortunate. One in seven Americans face hunger each day, and we aim to lower that number one box at a time.

our app will match resturaunts, hotels, events, ect that have leftover food. with those less fortunate. Create a account, select the food in your area, and pick it up at the location provided, all at no cost to you.
